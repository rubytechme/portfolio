# 🚀 Ruby's Portfolio Deployment Guide

## Current Status: Ready for GitHub Pages Activation

### ✅ What's Already Done:
- ✅ Portfolio website built with Next.js and responsive design
- ✅ GitHub repository created: `rubytechme/portfolio`
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured for automatic deployment
- ✅ Static export configuration set up
- ✅ All code committed and pushed to GitHub

### 🔧 Manual Step Required - Enable GitHub Pages:

**IMPORTANT**: You must manually enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

1. **Visit**: https://github.com/rubytechme/portfolio
2. **Click**: "Settings" tab (at the top)
3. **Navigate**: Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. **Configure Source**: 
   - Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** 
   - Do NOT select "Deploy from a branch"
5. **Save**: Click "Save"

### 🎯 After Enabling GitHub Pages:

1. **Monitor Deployment**: 
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Watch the "Deploy Next.js to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - It should complete successfully within 2-3 minutes

2. **Access Your Live Portfolio**:
   - URL: https://rubytechme.github.io/portfolio/
   - The site will showcase your professional portfolio with all projects and social links

### 🔍 Troubleshooting:

**If the workflow still fails after enabling Pages:**
- Check the Actions tab for error messages
- Ensure you selected "GitHub Actions" as the source (not "Deploy from a branch")
- Wait a few minutes and try pushing a small change to trigger a new deployment

**If the site loads but looks broken:**
- This usually means the basePath is incorrect
- The site should work correctly with our current configuration

### 📋 What Your Portfolio Includes:

- **Hero Section**: Professional introduction with photo
- **Biography**: Detailed background and expertise
- **Portfolio Projects**: 7 projects including EducateTheChild, EmpowerHer, etc.
- **Social Media Links**: LinkedIn, Instagram, GitHub, Medium, Twitter, Substack
- **Contact Information**: Professional email and social links
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with consistent spacing

### 🎉 Next Steps After Deployment:

1. Share your portfolio URL: `https://rubytechme.github.io/portfolio/`
2. Update your social media profiles with the portfolio link
3. Any future changes: just commit and push to main branch for automatic deployment
